# Snake Game
Implemented a game based on the popular snake game

The player controls the snake and must traverse it using the arrow keys while eating the cherries to become longer and longer.
The more cherries the snake eats, the more points the player is awarded.

Note: If you are at most 1 pixel away from the cherry, then the game believes that you ate the cherry even though you may not have eaten the cherry at its exact location.
